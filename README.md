# azure-health-bot
Deployed a Azure Health bot using Azure Services. 
The Project intregates simple bot which is made with QnA Maker in a static website which help end users to enquire about covid-19 related information.
Increase in demand for health service and enquiry about Covid19 has produce overhead for healthcare professionals and Customer service workers.Customer service, covid helpline and Hospital helpline were overwhelmed during this pandamic. Many people called helpline to enquire about covid which made created overwhelm ,which made people searching for emergency services difficult. Website for health service could include health bots which would reduce this overhead. Advantage is that In general it would make easiler for end users to search for covid norms ,book vaccine and so on. Medical chatbots would help by reducing hospital visits, reducing unnecessary treatments and procedures, and decreasing hospital admissions and readmissions as treatment compliance and knowledge about their symptoms improve. For patients, this comes with a lot of benefits: less time spent commuting to the doctorâ€™s office less money spent on unnecessary treatments and tests easy access to the doctor at the push of a button. People can easily search for queryor book an appointment just by chatting with the bot.
